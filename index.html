       <div class="container2">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the<br> 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to<br> make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also<br> the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was<br> popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing<br> Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software<br> like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</div><br> </center> 
  <div class="container3"><h1>Why do we use it?</h1></div>
  <div class="container4"><p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable<br> content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum<br> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to<br> using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many<br> desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum<br> as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many<br> web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,<br> sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the<br> like)</p></div><br>
